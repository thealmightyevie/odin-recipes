        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This fantastic cocktail can be made many ways, however this recipe is guaranteed to be the <i>ultimate</i> version. Despite the fact that it contains Long Island and tea in its name, its not related to either. In fact its better referred to as a "suicide soda"; a concoction of every drink poured into one cup. Enjoy!</p>
